          <h2>Narendranath Datta</h2>
          <p>
            <span>Swami Vivekananda</span>, known in his pre-monastic life as
            Narendra Nath Datta, was born in an affluent family in
            <span>Kolkata</span> on 12 January 1863. His father,
            <span>Vishwanath Datta</span>, was a successful attorney with
            interests in a wide range of subjects, and his mother,
            <span>Bhuvaneshwari Devi</span>, was endowed with deep devotion,
            strong character and other qualities. A precocious boy, Narendra
            excelled in music, gymnastics and studies. By the time he graduated
            from Calcutta University, he had acquired a vast knowledge of
            different subjects, especially Western philosophy and history. Born
            with a yogic temperament, he used to practise meditation even from
            his boyhood, and was associated with Brahmo Movement for some time.
            <br />
            <span>With Sri Ramakrishna</span>
            At the threshold of youth Narendra had to pass through a period of
            spiritual crisis when he was assailed by doubts about the existence
            of God. It was at that time he first heard about Sri Ramakrishna
            from one of his English professors at college. One day in November
            1881, Narendra went to meet Sri Ramakrishna who was staying at the
            Kali Temple in Dakshineshwar. He straightaway asked the Master a
            question which he had put to several others but had received no
            satisfactory answer: “Sir, have you seen God?” Without a moment’s
            hesitation, Sri Ramakrishna replied: “Yes, I have. I see Him as
            clearly as I see you, only in a much intenser sense.”
